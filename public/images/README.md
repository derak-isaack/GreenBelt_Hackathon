# Images Directory

To use a local forest path image:

1. Download the image from: https://pixabay.com/photos/forest-trail-sunbeams-forest-path-2942477/
2. Save it as `forest-path.jpg` in this directory
3. The CSS will automatically use the local image if it exists

Alternatively, you can update the CSS in `public/css/styles.css` to use your own image URL.
